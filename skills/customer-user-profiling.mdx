description: Create Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP) and user personas for new products/services. Use when entrepreneurs, innovators, or founders need to define target customers and users. Handles both B2C (customer = user) and B2B (customer ≠ user) scenarios. Apply when developing products, entering markets, refining go-to-market strategy, or designing user experiences.

# Customer & User Profiling

Help define target customers and users through ICP and Persona Creation methodologies.

## Core Distinction: Customer vs. User

**Customer**: Entity that pays (individual or company)
**User**: Individual who uses the product (always a person)

Profile separately when customer ≠ user:
- B2B: Company buys, employees use
- B2B2C: Business buys, consumers use
- Gift/family purchases: Buyer ≠ recipient

## Workflow

### 1. Clarify Context

Ask:
- What product/service are you profiling?
- B2C or B2B?
- Does customer = user?
- What research exists? (interviews, analytics, market data)

### 2. Build ICP(s)

Create 1-3 ICPs based on distinct segments.

**B2C Template:**
- Demographics: Age, income, location, family status
- Psychographics: Values, lifestyle, tech adoption
- Behaviors: Shopping patterns, decision style, channels
- Pain points: Problems, current solutions, unmet needs

**B2B Template:**
- Firmographics: Industry, size, location, growth stage
- Business traits: Budget, decision process, priorities
- Stakeholders: Economic buyer, technical buyer, users, champions
- Company needs: Objectives, challenges, success metrics

Make criteria specific and quantifiable (e.g., "50-500 employees" not "mid-size").

### 3. Create Personas (3-5 max)

For each ICP, create 1-3 representative personas.

**Persona Structure:**
```
Name: [Memorable fictional name]
Role: [Job title for B2B]
Age & Location: [Specific]
Background: [2-3 sentences on career/life]

Goals:
- [Primary goal]
- [Secondary goal]

Challenges:
- [Main frustration]
- [Key obstacle]

Behaviors:
- How they discover solutions
- Decision-making approach
- Preferred channels

Quote: "[Captures their perspective]"

Product Relationship:
- Discovery path
- Adoption drivers
- Potential objections
```

**B2B: Create personas for each stakeholder type:**
- Economic Buyer (controls budget, wants ROI)
- Technical Buyer (evaluates fit, wants reliability)
- End User (uses daily, wants ease of use)
- Champion (advocates internally, wants team wins)

### 4. Output Format

Structure deliverable as:

```markdown
# [Product Name] - Customer & User Profiles

## Context
[Customer vs. user relationship]

## Ideal Customer Profile(s)

### ICP 1: [Segment Name]
[Criteria using template above]

## Personas

### [Persona Name] - [Role]
[Full persona using template above]

## Strategic Implications
- Priority segment: [Why]
- Key messages: [Themes]
- Channels: [Where to reach them]
```

## Examples

**B2B SaaS (Customer ≠ User):**
Product: Agency project management tool
- Customer ICP: 20-100 employee agencies, $5M-50M revenue
- User personas: Agency Owner (economic buyer), PM (primary user), Designer (secondary user)

**B2C App (Customer = User):**
Product: Meal planning app
- Customer/User ICP: Parents ages 30-45, dual income $75K-150K, urban
- Persona: Jessica, 36, working mom juggling healthy eating + time constraints

## Avoid

- Generic profiles ("all small businesses")
- >5 personas (creates confusion)
- Assumptions without research
- Forgetting customer ≠ user distinction in B2B
- Static personas (update quarterly)
