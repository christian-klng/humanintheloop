# Partnership Opportunities

## Overview

Identify high-value institutional partnership opportunities for startups and create concise discussion documents that serve as a basis for partnership conversations. Partners are institutions that create mutual value through collaboration—NOT customers.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Startup Context

Review all available information about the startup:

1. **Search existing artifacts** in the conversation for:
   - Business model documentation
   - Product/service descriptions
   - Target markets and customer segments
   - Strategic goals and challenges
   - Previous partnership discussions
   - Value proposition and competitive advantages

2. **Extract key information**:
   - Core offering (product/service)
   - Industry and vertical
   - Stage of development (idea, MVP, growth, scale)
   - Geographic focus
   - Resources and capabilities
   - Strategic objectives

3. **If information is insufficient**, ask targeted questions:
   - "What problem does your startup solve?"
   - "Who are your current or target customers?"
   - "What stage is your startup at currently?"
   - "What are your key strategic goals for the next 12 months?"

### Step 2: Identify Partner Categories

Based on the startup context, determine relevant partner types. Consider reading `references/partnership_frameworks.md` for detailed partnership type definitions.

Common partner categories:
- **Research institutions**: Universities, research centers, labs
- **Industry associations**: Trade groups, professional organizations, standards bodies
- **Corporations**: Large companies for co-development, distribution, or pilots
- **Government agencies**: For regulatory support, funding, or public sector projects
- **NGOs and foundations**: For social impact, funding, or mission alignment
- **Technology platforms**: For integrations and ecosystem access

### Step 3: Research Potential Partners

Use web_search to identify specific institutions that match the criteria:

1. **Search for relevant institutions**:
   - Use queries like: "[industry] associations Germany", "research centers [technology field]", "[vertical] innovation hubs"
   - Identify 5-10 specific potential partners

2. **Research each potential partner**:
   - Use web_search and web_fetch to gather information about:
     - Their mission and strategic priorities
     - Current initiatives and programs
     - Past partnerships or collaborations
     - Decision-makers and relevant contacts
     - Recent news or announcements

3. **Assess partnership fit** using criteria:
   - Strategic alignment with startup's goals
   - Complementary capabilities
   - Mutual value potential
   - Feasibility and accessibility

### Step 4: Develop Value Propositions

For the top 3-5 potential partners, identify:

**For the startup:**
- Market access and credibility
- Resources (funding, expertise, infrastructure)
- Customer acquisition opportunities
- Product/service enhancement
- Risk mitigation

**For the partner:**
- Innovation and competitive advantage
- New revenue streams or cost savings
- Market positioning
- Access to new technologies or markets
- Corporate social responsibility alignment

### Step 5: Generate Concrete Partnership Ideas

Develop 2-3 specific collaboration concepts for each priority partner:
- Joint pilot projects
- Co-development initiatives
- Research collaborations
- Distribution or integration partnerships
- Knowledge exchange programs
- Event or marketing collaborations

Be specific and actionable. Avoid generic ideas.

### Step 6: Create the Discussion Document

Create an artifact titled "Gesprächsgrundlage für potenziellen Partner [Partner Name]" with the following structure:

```
# Gesprächsgrundlage für potenziellen Partner [Partner Name]

## Über [Partner Name]
- [2-3 bullet points summarizing the partner's focus and relevant initiatives]

## Strategische Passung
- [Why this partnership makes sense - 2-3 bullet points]

## Win-Win-Szenarien

### Mehrwert für [Startup Name]
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

### Mehrwert für [Partner Name]
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

## Konkrete Kooperationsideen

### Idee 1: [Title]
- [Brief description with specific deliverables]
- [Timeline indication if relevant]

### Idee 2: [Title]
- [Brief description with specific deliverables]
- [Timeline indication if relevant]

### Idee 3: [Title]
- [Brief description with specific deliverables]
- [Timeline indication if relevant]

## Nächste Schritte
- [Suggested approach for initial contact]
- [Recommended contact person/department if identified]
```

**Important guidelines:**
- Keep it concise—total length should be 1-2 pages maximum
- Use bullet points throughout
- Be specific and actionable
- Focus on mutual value creation
- Avoid marketing language; use factual, professional tone
- Include only information that is relevant for the first conversation

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill when:
- The user is looking for customers or clients (not partners)
- The request is about investor relations or fundraising
- The focus is on supplier relationships
- The user needs help with customer acquisition strategies
