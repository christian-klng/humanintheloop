# Problem Interviews (The Mom Test)

Conduct effective problem validation interviews to determine if a problem is worth solving before investing in building a solution.

## Core Philosophy

**The Mom Test Rule:** Talk about their life, not your idea.

Learn about customers' actual behaviors and problems, not compliments about your idea. Reveal truth through specific past behaviors rather than hypothetical future intentions.

## The Interview Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

**1. Define Your Hypothesis**
Clearly articulate:
- What problem you believe exists
- Who has this problem
- Why it matters to them
- What they currently do about it

**2. Identify Target Interviewees**
- Aim for 5-10 interviews minimum
- Focus on people who likely experience the problem
- Prioritize decision-makers or users
- Avoid only talking to friends/family

**3. Prepare Your Script**
- Copy and customize `assets/interview-script-template.md`
- Prepare 5-7 core questions tailored to your problem area
- Focus on past behavior, not hypotheticals
- Review question templates in `references/question-templates.md`

**4. Set Up Logistics**
- Request 20-30 minutes
- Use video calls for remote interviews
- Prepare note-taking system
- Frame as "learning from your experience" not "pitching"

### Phase 2: Conducting Interviews

**Opening (2-3 minutes)**
- Thank them
- Set expectations: "I'm here to learn, not pitch"
- Emphasize no right/wrong answers

**Context Building (5-7 minutes)**
- Ask about their role and typical day
- Understand how the problem area fits their workflow
- Listen actively, take notes

**Problem Discovery (10-12 minutes)**
- Ask about frustrations with current processes
- Request specific recent examples: "When was the last time...?"
- Explore what they've tried
- Quantify impact (time, money, stress)
- Use silence to encourage more sharing

**Current Solutions (5 minutes)**
- Understand what tools they use now
- Learn likes/dislikes about current solutions
- Discover what they're paying (time or money)
- Identify gaps

**Closing (3-5 minutes)**
- Ask the "magic wand" question
- Request introductions to others with the problem
- Seek commitment (follow-up meeting, introduction, pilot interest)

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Listen more than talk** - Aim for 70% them, 30% you
2. **Ask about past, not future** - "Tell me about the last time..." not "Would you use...?"
3. **Get specific examples** - Push past generics to concrete stories
4. **Don't pitch** - They should leave unclear about your solution
5. **Dig beneath feature requests** - Ask "why?" to uncover underlying problems
6. **Notice compliments** - Politely redirect to their problems
7. **Take detailed notes** - Expand them immediately after

### Phase 3: Analysis

**After Each Interview (5-10 minutes)**
- Expand cryptic notes while memory is fresh
- Capture key quotes verbatim
- Note any commitments made
- Identify red flags or surprises

**After 5-10 Interviews**
- Use `assets/analysis-template.md` to synthesize findings
- Look for patterns across interviews
- Score problem validation criteria
- Identify ideal customer profile
- Determine validated vs. invalidated assumptions
- Decide: proceed, iterate, pivot, or stop

## Avoid The Bad Data Trifecta

**1. Compliments**
- "That's a great idea!" / "I would definitely use that!"

→ Redirect: "Thanks! Tell me about the problems you currently face with..."

**2. Fluff (Hypotheticals & Generics)**
- "I probably would use something like that"

→ Redirect: "Can you tell me about a specific time when this happened to you?"

**3. Ideas (Feature Requests)**
- "You should add a calendar integration"

→ Redirect: "That's interesting. Why is that important to you? Tell me about a time when you needed that."

## Recognize Commitment & Advancement

The best validation comes when people commit something of value:
- **Time:** Schedule follow-up meeting
- **Reputation:** Introduce you to boss or colleague  
- **Money:** Express interest in paying or joining pilot
- **Effort:** Agree to test manual version

**Weak:** "That's interesting, let me know when it's ready" (no commitment)
**Strong:** "Can I introduce you to our VP who handles this?" (reputation commitment)

## Assess Problem Severity

Look for evidence of both **frequency** and **severity**:

**High Frequency:**
- "This happens every day/week"
- "Just yesterday I was dealing with..."
- Clear recent examples

**High Severity:**
- "This costs us $X or Y hours per [time period]"
- "I've tried 3 different solutions"
- Shows emotion when discussing

**Low Priority:** Struggles to remember last occurrence, vague answers

## Common Mistakes

❌ Pitching your solution
❌ Asking hypothetical questions ("Would you use...?")
❌ Leading questions ("Don't you hate when...?")
❌ Talking >30% of the time
❌ Taking compliments as validation
❌ Only interviewing easy-to-reach people
❌ Stopping after 2-3 interviews
❌ Interviewing without a hypothesis
❌ Defending your idea
❌ Skipping note-taking

## Quick Decision Tree

**"How many interviews needed?"**
- Minimum: 5-10 to see patterns
- Continue if: Still learning new things
- Stop when: Hearing same stories repeatedly

**"Can't get interviews?"**
- Consider: community research, surveys, data analysis
- But: Nothing fully replaces customer conversations

## Success Criteria

Answer these confidently:
1. **How often does this problem occur?** (Daily? Weekly? Rarely?)
2. **How painful is it?** (Quantified in time, money, emotional cost)
3. **What do people use now?** (Existing solutions and costs)
4. **What's missing?** (Gaps in current solutions)
5. **Would they switch?** (Evidence of willingness to change)
6. **Who has it worst?** (Ideal customer profile)

If unable to answer confidently, conduct more interviews or pivot hypothesis.

## Next Steps

**If problem validated:**
- Begin solution validation
- Build minimal prototypes for feedback
- Consider concierge MVP with committed customers

**If NOT validated:**
- Pivot to different problem
- Adjust target customer segment
- Consider abandoning direction

**Goal:** Learn the truth, not confirm your idea is good. Make informed decisions about where to invest time.
