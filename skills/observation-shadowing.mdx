# Observation & Shadowing

Validate problems and understand workflows by observing people work in their natural environment without interfering.

## Core Philosophy

**Watch, don't ask.** Actions reveal truth that words cannot capture. People often can't articulate their process, workarounds, or pain points—but you can see them.

Observation shows actual behavior vs. reported behavior, reveals unconscious habits and workarounds, and captures context that interviews miss.

## The Observation Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

**1. Define Your Focus**
Clearly articulate:
- What process or workflow to observe
- What problems you're investigating
- What specific behaviors to watch for
- What context matters

**2. Identify Observation Subjects**
- Target 3-5 observation sessions minimum
- Select people who perform the task regularly
- Prioritize experienced users (they've developed workarounds)
- Include variety (different roles, skill levels, contexts)

**3. Secure Access**
- Request 1-4 hours depending on task cycle time
- Explain you're studying the process, not evaluating them
- Emphasize you'll be silent observer
- Get permission to take notes/photos (no faces if sensitive)
- Schedule when they'll be doing the target activity

**4. Prepare Observation Framework**
Use `assets/observation-template.md` to structure what to watch for:
- Workflow steps and sequence
- Time spent on each step
- Tools and workarounds used
- Frustration signals (sighs, complaints, errors)
- Context switches and interruptions

### Phase 2: Conducting Observation

**Arrival (5 minutes)**
- Arrive early, set up unobtrusively
- Remind them to work normally
- Explain you may ask clarifying questions after
- Position yourself where you can see clearly without interfering

**Silent Observation (main session)**
- Remain completely silent during work
- Take detailed notes on everything
- Photograph workspace, tools, materials (with permission)
- Note time stamps for each step
- Watch for:
  - **Friction points:** Where they slow down, hesitate, or struggle
  - **Workarounds:** Non-standard methods they've developed
  - **Manual steps:** Things that could be automated
  - **Context switches:** When they switch tools or tasks
  - **Errors:** Mistakes and how they recover
  - **Emotional signals:** Frustration, confusion, satisfaction

**Observation Rules:**
1. **Stay silent** - Don't interrupt their flow
2. **Be invisible** - Don't make them self-conscious
3. **Document everything** - Note even small details
4. **Time everything** - Quantify how long steps take
5. **Watch the context** - Environment, tools, interruptions matter
6. **Notice workarounds** - The unofficial process reveals pain points
7. **Capture the artifacts** - Photo screens, documents, tools they use

**After Observation Q&A (15-30 minutes)**
- Now ask clarifying questions about what you saw
- Focus on specific moments: "I noticed you did X, why?"
- Explore workarounds: "How did you develop that method?"
- Understand pain points: "That step took 10 minutes, is that typical?"
- Learn history: "Have you tried other ways to do this?"

### Phase 3: Analysis

**Immediately After (15-20 minutes)**
- Expand abbreviated notes while memory is fresh
- Draw workflow diagrams showing actual vs. intended process
- Identify pain points observed
- Quantify time costs for different steps
- Note quotes from post-observation discussion

**After 3-5 Sessions**
Use `assets/synthesis-template.md` to analyze patterns:
- Common pain points across sessions
- Workflow variations and why they occur
- Quantified time/cost of inefficiencies
- Workarounds that indicate unmet needs
- Context factors that impact the work

## What to Look For

### Friction Indicators

**Behavioral Signals:**
- Hesitation before starting a step
- Checking reference materials repeatedly
- Switching between multiple tools
- Redoing work or fixing errors
- Sighs, head shaking, frustrated expressions

**Time Signals:**
- Steps that take unexpectedly long
- Waiting periods (for loading, approval, responses)
- Repeated back-and-forth between systems
- Manual data entry or copying

**Workaround Signals:**
- Post-it notes with instructions
- Personal spreadsheets or documents as aids
- Phone/paper used alongside digital tools
- Checking work multiple times
- Asking colleagues for help

### Workflow Insights

Map the actual workflow vs. intended:
- **Official process:** What the manual says
- **Actual process:** What you observe
- **Gaps:** Where they diverge and why

Document:
- Steps in sequence
- Time per step
- Tools/systems used
- Decision points
- Pain points and workarounds
- Collaboration needs

### Context Factors

Environmental and situational factors that impact work:
- Physical workspace limitations
- Available tools and their condition
- Interruptions and distractions
- Time pressures
- Organizational constraints
- Social/collaboration dynamics

## Types of Observation

### 1. Passive Shadowing
Follow someone through their entire workflow without interfering.

**Best for:**
- Understanding end-to-end processes
- Seeing how tasks fit into broader workflow
- Identifying context switches
- Learning organizational/social factors

**Duration:** 2-4 hours or full task cycle

### 2. Task-Focused Observation
Watch someone perform a specific task repeatedly.

**Best for:**
- Detailed understanding of specific workflow
- Identifying micro-inefficiencies
- Quantifying time costs precisely
- Comparing approaches across users

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

### 3. Contextual Inquiry (Semi-Guided)
Observe while occasionally asking questions during natural breaks.

**Best for:**
- Understanding decision-making process
- Learning rationale behind actions
- Building rapport while observing
- When pure silence would be awkward

**Duration:** 1-3 hours

**Note:** Still minimize interruptions—ask only during natural pauses.

### 4. Workspace Observation
Study the physical/digital workspace without watching active work.

**Best for:**
- Understanding tool ecosystem
- Seeing workarounds (sticky notes, cheat sheets)
- Identifying integration gaps
- Quick reconnaissance before interviews

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

## Common Mistakes

❌ Interrupting with questions during work
❌ Making the subject self-conscious
❌ Only watching once (patterns emerge across sessions)
❌ Focusing only on the task, ignoring context
❌ Not quantifying time spent
❌ Missing the workarounds and unofficial processes
❌ Observing only expert users (beginners reveal different pain points)
❌ Not following up with questions after
❌ Assuming you understand without asking
❌ Forgetting to get permission for photos/recording

## Combining with Interviews

Observation and interviews are complementary:

**Observe first, then interview:**
- Observation: See actual behavior and workarounds
- Interview: Understand why, explore history, validate insights

**Advantages of this sequence:**
- More credible in interview (saw the real process)
- Can ask specific questions about what you observed
- Subjects less defensive (you already know the truth)
- Better rapport (showed genuine interest)

**Example flow:**
1. Shadow someone for 2 hours
2. Immediately after: 20-minute Q&A about what you saw
3. Follow-up: Problem interview focusing on specific pain points observed

## Resources

### Assets (copy and customize)
- **observation-template.md** - Framework for structured observation notes
- **synthesis-template.md** - Template for analyzing multiple observation sessions
- **observation-checklist.md** - Pre-session checklist and what to watch for

### References (load as needed)
- **body-language-guide.md** - Reading frustration and confusion signals
- **workflow-mapping.md** - Techniques for documenting observed processes

## Success Criteria

Answer these after 3-5 sessions:
1. **What is the actual workflow?** (Steps, sequence, time)
2. **Where are the friction points?** (Specific pain points observed)
3. **What workarounds exist?** (Unofficial processes developed)
4. **How much does the problem cost?** (Quantified in time)
5. **What's the context?** (Environmental and organizational factors)
6. **How does it vary?** (Differences across users, situations)

If unable to answer confidently, conduct more observations or adjust focus.

## When to Use Observation vs. Interviews

**Prefer observation when:**
- Workflows are complex or tacit (hard to describe)
- Users may not be aware of their problems
- Actual vs. reported behavior matters
- Need to quantify time costs precisely
- Understanding context is critical

**Prefer interviews when:**
- Need to understand motivations and history
- Decision-making process is key
- Problem is well-articulated by users
- Observation access is difficult
- Need to reach many people quickly

**Best: Use both**
- Observe to see actual behavior
- Interview to understand why and explore alternatives

## Next Steps

**If problems validated through observation:**
- Quantify impact across broader sample
- Conduct follow-up interviews to understand "why"
- Test solution concepts with those you observed
- Build for the actual workflow, not the idealized one

**If problems NOT clear from observation:**
- Adjust focus to different part of workflow
- Observe different user types or contexts
- Combine with interviews for deeper understanding
- Consider that problem may not exist as hypothesized

**Remember:** Observe actual behavior, not idealized processes. The workarounds and unofficial methods reveal the real problems.
