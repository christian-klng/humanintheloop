# Problem Statement Skill for Startup Founders

## Purpose
This skill helps startup founders, corporate innovators, and entrepreneurs develop compelling problem descriptions—for pitches, investor meetings, and customer outreach. A clear, tangible problem formulation is the foundation for product-market fit and successful communication.

## Core Principles of Strong Problem Formulation

### 1. Specificity Over Generality
**Weak:** "Companies have communication problems"
**Strong:** "B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees lose an average of 15 hours per week due to fragmented communication across Slack, email, Notion, and Zoom, resulting in missed deadlines and frustration for 73% of teams"

### 2. Quantifiable Impact
Describe the problem in measurable terms:
- **Time:** How many hours/days are lost?
- **Money:** What direct/indirect costs occur?
- **Stress:** How severe is the emotional burden? (Frustration, anxiety, overwhelm)
- **Opportunity costs:** What could be achieved instead?

### 3. Human Impact
Technical problems are often less compelling than their human consequences:
- **Not:** "API latency is 2000ms"
- **Instead:** "Developers wait 45 minutes daily for slow API responses, leading to frustration, productivity loss, and ultimately burnout"

## Structured Approach to Problem Formulation

### Step 1: Situation Description (WHO + WHERE)
Define precisely:
- **Who** is affected? (Specific target audience, not generalities)
- **In what situation** does the problem occur? (Context, framework conditions)

**Example:** "Marketing managers in fast-growing e-commerce companies (€10-50M revenue) juggling 5+ different advertising channels"

### Step 2: The Problem Itself (WHAT)
- What exactly isn't working?
- What obstacles, friction, or barriers exist?
- Be specific and avoid buzzwords

**Example:** "They spend 12+ hours per week manually consolidating data from Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, Shopify, and TikTok into Excel, just to get a fragmented overview of ROAS"

### Step 3: Impact (IMPACT)
Describe the **direct** and **indirect** consequences:

**Direct Impact:**
- Time loss (quantified)
- Money loss (quantified)
- Error rate
- Inefficiency

**Indirect Impact:**
- Stress, frustration, burnout risk
- Missed opportunities
- Competitive disadvantage
- Team dynamics problems
- Customer satisfaction

**Example:** "This leads to delayed campaign optimizations (average 3-5 day delay), 15-30% advertising budget waste through non-optimized channels, and chronic stress in the marketing team"

### Step 4: Failed Alternatives (WHY NOW?)
Show that existing solutions are inadequate:

**Structure:**
1. **Alternative A:** [Existing approach]
   - Why used: [Reason]
   - Why inadequate: [Limitation]

2. **Alternative B:** [Other solution]
   - Why used: [Reason]
   - Why inadequate: [Limitation]

3. **Status Quo:** Do nothing
   - Why unacceptable: [Consequence]

**Example:**
- **Excel/Google Sheets:** Flexible, but manual work takes too much time, error-prone
- **Existing Analytics Tools:** Expensive (from €500/month), bloated with unneeded features, steep learning curve
- **Do nothing:** Competitors optimize faster, budget waste grows

### Step 5: Problem Escalation (URGENCY)
Why is the problem becoming more urgent?
- Market trends
- Technological developments
- Regulatory changes
- Competitive pressure
- Growth dynamics

**Example:** "With increasing fragmentation of advertising channels (TikTok Shop, Amazon Ads, new social platforms), this problem becomes exponentially worse—each new channel means an additional 2-3 hours of data work per week"

## Quality Criteria Checklist

A strong problem formulation meets ALL of the following criteria:

- [ ] **Specific:** Clear target audience, no generalizations
- [ ] **Quantified:** Concrete numbers for time, money, or impact
- [ ] **Emotionally resonant:** The pain is tangible and relatable
- [ ] **Frequent:** The problem occurs regularly (daily/weekly)
- [ ] **Urgent:** There's a reason to act NOW
- [ ] **Expensive alternatives:** Existing solutions are unsatisfactory
- [ ] **Scalable:** The problem intensifies with growth
- [ ] **Validated:** Real quotes or data from affected parties

## Best Practices

### DOs:
- **Use real quotes** from customers/interviews: "Every Monday I spend 3 hours collecting data instead of developing strategy"
- **Be precise with numbers:** Not "a lot of time" but "12-15 hours per week"
- **Tell stories:** A concrete day in the life of the persona
- **Show escalation:** "What was manageable with 5 campaigns is impossible with 20 campaigns"
- **Connect to business impact:** Time loss → Missed revenue opportunities

### DON'Ts:
- ❌ Vague formulations: "many companies," "often," "sometimes"
- ❌ Solution-focused instead of problem-focused
- ❌ Technical jargon without human connection
- ❌ Made-up numbers without sources
- ❌ Problems that only occur once a year
- ❌ "Nice-to-have" instead of "must-have" problems

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

### Mistake 1: Too General
**Weak:** "Companies need better software"
**Strong:** "Franchise chains with 10-50 locations lose 20+ hours per week due to inconsistent inventory management between locations, resulting in excess inventory (average €15,000 tied-up capital) and out-of-stocks (5-8% revenue loss)"

### Mistake 2: Feature-Problem Instead of Real Problem
**Weak:** "There's no app for X"
**Strong:** "Physiotherapists spend 30% of their working time on paperwork and administration instead of with patients, resulting in 20-30% less treatment capacity and corresponding revenue loss"

### Mistake 3: Missing Quantification
**Weak:** "This costs a lot of time"
**Strong:** "CFOs in medium-sized companies waste 15-20 hours monthly on manual report creation, which at a salary of €120,000/year means costs of approximately €12,000/year just for this activity"

### Mistake 4: No Alternatives Mentioned
**Problem:** If you don't show why existing solutions fail, your problem doesn't seem urgent enough.
**Solution:** Show concretely what people have already tried and why it doesn't work.

## Workflow for Claude

When a user requests support with problem formulation, Claude should:

1. **Gather information:**
   - Who is the target audience? (As specific as possible)
   - What is the concrete pain point?
   - What numbers/data exist? (Time, money, frequency)
   - What solutions have they already tried?
   - Why is now the right time?

2. **Iteratively refine:**
   - From general to specific
   - From qualitative to quantitative
   - From symptom to root cause
   - From feature to real pain

3. **Ask validation questions:**
   - "Does this problem really occur regularly?"
   - "Would affected parties pay for this?"
   - "Is the pain big enough for active action?"
   - "Have you validated this with real customers?"

4. **Structure output:** Use the defined format above

## Example: Complete Problem Formulation

### Problem Formulation: Fragmented Customer Data in Fast-Growing SaaS Startups

**Target Audience & Situation:**
Customer Success Managers in B2B SaaS startups (Series A/B, 50-200 customers, ARR €1-10M) transitioning from "founder does everything" to structured CS team.

**The Problem:**
Customer data is scattered across 5-8 different tools (CRM, support tickets, product usage, surveys, emails, Slack) without central visibility. A CSM needs 15-25 minutes before a customer call to get a complete overview—often incomplete and outdated.

**Impact:**

*Direct Costs:*
- Time loss: 8-12 hours per CSM per week just for data gathering
- With 3 CSMs = ~1,500 hours/year wasted
- Cost: approximately €75,000/year in pure labor time
- 20-30% higher churn rate than competitors due to lack of proactivity

*Indirect Costs:*
- Missed upsell opportunities (estimated 15-25% of ARR)
- Frustrated CSMs leave after 12-18 months (40% turnover vs. 20%)
- Customers feel misunderstood, reducing NPS by 15-20 points
- Reactive instead of proactive CS—problems detected too late

**Failed Alternatives:**

*Excel/Notion:*
- **What:** Manual compilation of customer data in sheets
- **Limitation:** Takes too long, always outdated, not scalable beyond 50+ customers
- **Consequence:** Not used, CSMs continue improvising

*Enterprise CS Platforms (Gainsight, ChurnZero):*
- **What:** All-in-one solutions with all features
- **Limitation:** €30,000-100,000/year, 3-6 months setup, too complex for stage
- **Consequence:** Too expensive and time-consuming for Series A startups

*Build Custom Solution:*
- **What:** Engineering team builds internal dashboard
- **Limitation:** 3-6 months dev time, continuously ties up 1-2 engineers
- **Consequence:** Opportunity cost of €150,000-300,000, no core product focus

*Status Quo:*
- **Consequence:** With each new tool it gets worse, scaling CS team impossible, churn rises, competitors with better systems win

**Urgency:**
Series A/B startups must scale quickly—each new customer increases complexity. Investors demand lower churn rates and higher Net Revenue Retention. In 12 months the problem will be 3x larger (more customers, more tools, more CSMs). Those who don't act now lose competitive advantage in Customer Success.

**Validation:**
- Interview with 25 CS leaders in SaaS startups: 88% cite fragmented data as top-3 problem
- "I spend more time tool-switching than with customers" (CSM, Series A startup)
- "We lost two great CSMs because they were frustrated they couldn't work effectively" (VP CS, Series B)

## Advanced Techniques

### Problem Amplification
Show how the problem intensifies with time/growth:
- "What costs 2 hours/week today will cost 20 hours/week next year"
- "Manually manageable with 10 customers, impossible with 100 customers"

### Pain-Chain Analysis
Show the cascade of problems:
Problem A → leads to → Problem B → leads to → Problem C (catastrophe)

**Example:**
Manual data entry → Errors in reports → Wrong decisions → Revenue loss → Job loss

### Competitor Comparison
"While you do X, your competitors do Y and win"

### The "3 AM Test"
"Does this problem keep you up at night? If not, it's not big enough."

## Conclusion

A compelling problem formulation is not a marketing trick, but genuine understanding of your target audience's pain points. The best problem formulation comes from real conversations with affected parties, not from assumptions.

**Golden Rule:** If a potential customer reads your problem description and says "How did you know? That's EXACTLY my life!"—then you've won.
