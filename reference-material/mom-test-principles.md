# The Mom Test: Core Principles

## The Central Rule

The Mom Test is simple: **Talk about their life, not your idea.**

The test gets its name from the question: "Would your mom lie to you?" Even your mom will lie about whether your business is a good idea if you ask directly. But she can't lie about her problems and past behaviors.

## Three Core Rules

### Rule 1: Talk About Their Life, Not Your Ideas
- Don't tell them what you're building or planning
- Don't ask hypothetical questions ("Would you use...?")
- Do ask about their current behaviors and past experiences
- Do ask about their problems and workflows

**Bad:** "Would you use an app that helps you track expenses?"
**Good:** "How do you currently track your expenses?" followed by "What's frustrating about that?"

### Rule 2: Ask About Specifics in the Past, Not Generics or Opinions About the Future
- Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior
- Specifics reveal truth; generics reveal politeness
- Look for concrete examples and recent experiences

**Bad:** "Do you think you would use this feature?"
**Good:** "When was the last time you needed to do X? Walk me through what happened."

### Rule 3: Talk Less, Listen More
- You should be talking less than 30% of the time
- Every time you talk, you're not learning
- Use silence to encourage them to keep sharing
- Take notes, but maintain eye contact

## Key Concepts

### Compliments vs. Truth
- Compliments feel good but don't help you build a better product
- "That's a great idea!" is worthless
- "I would definitely use that" is equally worthless
- Push past politeness to uncover real problems

### Feature Requests vs. Problems
- Features are what people ask for
- Problems are what they actually have
- Always dig deeper: "Why do you want that feature?"
- Understand the underlying problem, not the proposed solution

### The Bad Data Trifecta to Avoid
1. **Compliments** - "That's a great idea!"
2. **Fluff (hypotheticals and generics)** - "I would probably use that"
3. **Ideas (feature requests)** - "You should add a calendar feature"

All three should trigger deeper questions to get to the truth beneath.

### Commitment and Advancement
- The best validation is when someone commits something of value
- Time, money, reputation, or effort
- Examples: scheduling a follow-up, making an introduction, committing to a pilot
- "That's interesting, let me know when it's ready" is NOT commitment

## Signs You're Doing It Wrong

1. You're pitching instead of learning
2. They're giving you compliments instead of criticism
3. You're hearing "I would definitely use that" repeatedly
4. You're collecting opinions instead of facts
5. You're defending your idea during the conversation
6. You're talking more than 40% of the time

## Signs You're Doing It Right

1. They're doing most of the talking
2. You're hearing specific stories from their past
3. They're telling you about problems and frustrations
4. You're taking lots of notes on their workflows
5. You're occasionally surprised by what you learn
6. You're zeroing in on the severity and frequency of problems
